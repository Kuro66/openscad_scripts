# Openscad scripts

A collection of my openscad scripts and creations.

## customizable-keyring-style.scad

This script is a remix of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3496798.

I've added the possibility to make the letters go outwards instead of inwards. To do so, just comment / uncomment the style variables.

The rest of the code was left untouched.

## support_alarme.scad

This script allows the creation of a house-alarm holder. The height of the object is modifiable to fit different needs.
